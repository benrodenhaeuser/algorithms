# given a string, find all permutations of the string

=begin

I. understanding the problem.

- a string permutation is a way to reorder the letters in the string
  - e.g. 'neb' is a permutation of 'ben'
  - and 'nonb' is a permutation of 'bonn'
- how many permutations do we get given an input string?
  - has to do with length of string, e.g.
    - 'a' has one permutation ('a')
    - 'ab' has two permutations ('ab', 'ba')
  - also depends on whether there are repetitions in input string
    - 'ab' has two permutations
    - 'bb' has only one

- let us first assume that we have a string of mutually distinct characters
  - 'abc' is such a string
  - 'abb' is not

II. data structure

- internally, we will represent the string as an array of chars (our stock)

III. solution

- initialize array of permutations (initially empty)
- for each character from our stock:
  - that character concatenated with all permutations of the remaining stock goes into our array of permutations

# solution 1

def permutations(string)
  if string.size == 1
    perms = [string]
  else
    perms = []
    string.chars.each_index do |index|
      permutations(string[0...index] + string[index + 1..-1]).each do |perm|
        perms << string[index] + perm
      end
    end
  end
  perms.uniq
end

puts Benchmark.realtime { permutations('abcd') } # 0.0001009996049106121
puts Benchmark.realtime { permutations('aaaaaaaaa') } # 0.9907749998383224

# => the call to uniq at the end is heavy-handed. much better to not generate those permutations in the first place.

# solution 2

def build_stock(string)
  stock = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = 0 }
  string.chars.each do |char|
    stock[char] += 1
  end
  stock
end

def permutations(string)
  permus = []
  stock = build_stock(string)
  generate_permutations(stock, '', permus)
  permus
end

def generate_permutations(stock, chosen, permus)
  if stock.keys.none? { |key| stock[key] > 0 }
    permus << chosen
  else
    stock.keys.each do |choice|
      if stock[choice] > 0
        stock[choice] -= 1
        generate_permutations(stock, chosen + choice, permus)
        stock[choice] += 1
      end
    end
  end
  nil
end


puts Benchmark.realtime { permutations('abcd') } # 0.00016999989748001099
puts Benchmark.realtime { permutations('aaaaaaaaa') } # 2.2999942302703857e-05

# the second solution is a lot more efficient for repetitive strings
